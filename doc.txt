create vritual env
 Install virtual environment using : pip install virtualenvwrapper-win

 
  creating virtual environment : python -m venv myenv

  activating the virtaul environment : .\myenv\Scripts\activate

  We are done with our virtaul environment now we have to setup django

  instll django : pip install Django
django-admin startproject LicenseManagementSys 
   creating project  : 
 project has been created move to the project : cd NewsLicenseManagementSysBit

 lets test the project is running or not using : python manage.py runserver

creating app : python manage.py startapp ClientSideApp,CentralServerapp

make migrations : 
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

include app in main project url: path('', include ("ClientSideApp.urls")), 

 
  and the website is rendering to the index page but it is not rendering because we haved to define in settings.py file the template directory
'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')],

 now we have to link the css and other static files 
 
STATICFILES_DIRS=[
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static')
]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'assets')

now create folder static and paste all folder like css js

run command to : python manage.py collectstatic
